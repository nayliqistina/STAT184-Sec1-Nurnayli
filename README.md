# Diabetes Analysis Project

##Introduction
This repository contains the data and code used for analyzing the relationship between diabetes outcomes and key biomarkeers such as Glucose and Insulin. The project aims to identify whichj biomarkers are the most significant drivers of diabetes risk.

## Implementation
The analysis was performed in R using:
- Data cleaning methods with 'dplyr' and 'tidyr'.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with 'ggplot2'.
- Statistical modeling and visualization to examine patterns in the dataset.

### Key Files
- 'diabetes_dataset.csv': Contains patient medical data including biomarkers and diabetes outcomes.
- 'diabetes_study.R': Rscript used for data preprocessing and analysis.

## Results
The results indicate significant cerrelations between diabetes outcomes and the biomarkers analyzed. Visualizations plots provided insights into these relationships.
